        "abstract": "Voice jitter is defined as a random perturbation of the glottal cycle duration which can be useful for voice parametrization and that usually depends on finding fiducial points in this signal. In this paper, a novel application of the Fourier-based high-order synchrosqueezing (FSSTN) operators on voice signals is introduced for voice jitter estimation without period-segmentation. To this end, an innovative interpretation of the relative jitter formula in terms of the total variation of the sequence of periods is proposed. This allows us to derive an algorithm for jitter estimation that uses the (continuous) instantaneous fundamental frequency of the signal and its first derivative (chirp rate) which can be obtained, respectively, from the local complex frequency and the local complex modulation FSSTN operators. Numerical experiments using synthetic signals with known true jitter show that this novel approach yields similar results to \u2026"

Then, we describe an algorithm to classify these points in an unsupervised way, based on the analysis of the stability of their location with respect to additive noise. Finally, potential uses of the classification of zeros of the spectrogram for signal detection and denoising are investigated, and compared with other methods on both synthetic and real-world signals."

The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, to propose a pattern recognition approach for automatic voice signal typing based on a multi-class linear Support Vector Machine, and using rather well-known parameters like Jitter, Shimmer, Harmonic-to-Noise Ratio, and Cepstral Prominence Peak in combination with nonlinear dynamics measures. Two novel features are also proposed as objective parameters.

        "abstract": "Signal processing in the time-frequency plane has a long history and remains a field of methodological innovation. For instance, detection and denoising based on the zeros of the spectrogram have been proposed since 2015, contrasting with a long history of focusing on larger values of the spectrogram. Yet, unlike neighboring fields like optimization and machine learning, time-frequency signal processing lacks widely-adopted benchmarking tools. In this work, we contribute an open-source, Python-based toolbox termed MCSM-Benchs for benchmarking multi-component signal analysis methods, and we demonstrate our toolbox on three time-frequency benchmarks. First, we compare different methods for signal detection based on the zeros of the spectrogram, including unexplored variations of previously proposed detection tests. Second, we compare zero-based denoising methods to both classical and novel methods based on large values and ridges of the spectrogram. Finally, we compare the denoising performance of these methods against typical spectrogram thresholding strategies, in terms of post-processing artifacts commonly referred to as musical noise. At a low level, the obtained results provide new insight on the assessed approaches, and in particular research directions to further develop zero-based methods. At a higher level, our benchmarks exemplify the benefits of using a public, collaborative, common framework for benchmarking."

Two examples of such subjective tasks are the classification of voices in three types according to their periodicity, also termed voice typing, and the evaluation of six aspects of voice quality by means of the consensus auditory-perceptual evaluation of voice (CAPE-V) protocol. In this paper, two approaches to emulate each of those tasks are introduced, based on simple features extracted from scattering transform coefficients and support vector machines.

State-of-the-art methods use specific assumptions and paradigms which can produce very different results in specific use cases. Hence, this paper aims to present and discuss the advantages and the limitations of several promising recent approaches respectively applied to signal denoising, mode retrieval and instantaneous frequency estimation through a comparative evaluation benchmark. Our numerical experiments show the specific scenarios where each method is the more adapted in terms of quality of mode separation and reconstruction while also considering the computational efficiency."

When a signal is present, large holes are created in this pattern. Recently, several methods have been proposed to detect and use them as masks for signal reconstruction. Yet, no systematic studies for tuning their hyperparameters on real data have been conducted. We investigate one key hyperparameter, the interaction scale r0, intuitively corresponding to the radius of a hole caused by a well-localized signal in the TF plane. We benchmark adaptive tuning protocols for r0 from the spatial statistics literature, which take as input simulated noise realizations and the actual data. We use non-Gaussian noise, audio signals, and the reconstruction performance is assessed with audio quality metrics. Results show that tuning strategies can depend both on the protocol and the data, highlighting the importance of benchmarking such approaches"

While TDA has emerged as a powerful analytical tool for data with pronounced topological structures, here we demonstrate its applicability for general problems of signal processing, without any a-priori geometric feature. Our methods are well-suited to a wide array of time-dependent signals in different scientific domains, with acoustic signals being a particularly important application. We invoke time-frequency representations of such signals, focusing on their zeros which are gaining salience as a signal processing tool in view of their stability properties. Leveraging state-of-the-art topological concepts, such as stable and minimal volumes, we develop a complete suite of TDA-based methods to explore the delicate stochastic geometry of these zeros, capturing signals based on the disruption they cause to this rigid, hyperuniform spatial structure. Unlike classical spatial data tools, TDA is able to capture the full spectrum of the stochastic geometry of the zeros, thereby leading to powerful inferential outcomes that are underpinned by a principled statistical foundation. This is reflected in the power and versatility of our applications, which include competitive performance in processing. a wide variety of audio signals (esp. in low SNR regimes), effective detection and reconstruction of gravitational wave signals (a reputed signal processing challenge with non-Gaussian noise), and medical time series data from EEGs, indicating a wide horizon for the approach and methods introduced in this paper."

Features extracted from this histogram are later used to classify the zeros using a non-supervised clusterization algorithm. A denoising approach based on the classification of the spectrogram zeros is also introduced.
