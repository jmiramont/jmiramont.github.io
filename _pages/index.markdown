    <p>I'm a signal processer doing data analysis (or maybe the other way around...).</p>
    <p>I am mostly interested in the intersection of classical approaches to signal processing, like the short-time Fourier transform, wavelets, and synchrosqueezing, with more modern techniques like deep learning and topological data analysis.</p>
